<p>You know the index at the end of a book where you look up which pages people and terms occur? Useful right?</p><p>In this Bite you will build your own, but instead of page numbers we will use line numbers.</p><p>We will be using the story of <a href="https://www.dltk-teach.com/rhymes/littlered/story.htm" target="_blank">Little Red Riding Hood</a> (the tests also run your code against <a href="https://parenting.firstcry.com/articles/top-15-short-moral-stories-for-kids/" target="_blank">The Needle Tree</a>).</p><p>Complete <code>make_character_index</code> (scroll down) that takes a multiline text (story) string and a list of characters.</p><p>Parse the text and match the characters (case insensitively) keeping track of the line numbers where they appeared.</p><p>One twist: some characters have synonyms, in that case you have to match them all and return the first one, e.g. when one of <code>('Grandmother', 'Grandma', 'Granny')</code> matches, you return the first = <i>Grandmother</i>.</p><p>The return data is a <code>dict</code> where the <i>keys</i> are the characters and the <i>values</i> are <code>list</code>s of line numbers of appearances in <strong>sorted</strong> order.</p><p>See also the <i>tests</i> for the expected data.</p><p>We hope this is a fun exercise that keeps your Python fresh. Now go crack this Bite and remember: keep calm and code in Python!</p>
