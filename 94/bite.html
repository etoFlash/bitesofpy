<p><a href="https://pybit.es/pycon-2018" target="_blank">PyCon2018</a> was awesome! But you clearly had to choose the whole time, so much was going on!</p><p>In this Bite we parsed all the talks from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsX05-2sVSH7Nx3zuk3NYuQ/videos?view=0&flow=grid&sort=p" target="_blank">PyCon 2018 YT channel</a> and stored them into a list of Video namedtuples. This nested data structure is stored in a <code>pickle</code> file. The data looks like this:<pre>
[Video(id='T-TwcmT6Rcw',
             title='Raymond Hettinger - Dataclasses:  The code generator ...',
             duration='PT45M8S',
             metrics={'viewCount': '6047', 'likeCount': '139', 'dislikeCount': '2',
                              'favoriteCount': '0', 'commentCount': '14'}),
 Video(id='duvZ-2UK0fc', title='Ned Batchelder .... same attributes ...),
 Video(id='GBQAKldqgZs', title='Kenneth Reitz ....same attributes ...),
 ... same Video namedtuples ...]

See the docstrings and the tests for more info... </p><p>Have fun and keep calm and code in Python!</p>
