<p><blockquote>An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.[1] For example, the word anagram can be rearranged into "naga ram". Or for example, the word binary can be rearranged into "brainy". - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagram" target="_blank">source</a></blockquote></p><p>In this Bite you complete the function below receiving two words and return True/False if word2 is an anagram of word1. See the <i>tests</i> for some interesting anagrams. See if you can use a data structure of the standard library?</p>
