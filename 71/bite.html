<p>In this Bite you write a small class to keep track of the max score in a game. When called as a function it receives a new score and returns the max score. Note it should work with negative numbers as well.</p><p>This is how it should work:<br><pre>
  >>> from record import RecordScore

  >>> record = RecordScore()
  >>> print(record(10))
  10
  >>> print(record(9))
  10
  >>> print(record(11))  # new max
  11

  >>> record = RecordScore()
  >>> print(record(-5))
  -5
  >>> print(record(-10))
  -5
  >>> print(record(-2))  # new max
  -2
</pre></p><p>Use the <code>__call__</code> dunder ("special") method to make the <code>RecordScore</code> class callable.</p><p>Good luck and keep calm and code in Python!</p>
