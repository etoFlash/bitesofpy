<p>The Data Processing Department was writing a script to import some json data into Python dictionaries for analysis, but their program has a bug!</p>
<p>Some of the dictionary keys start with <code>@</code> symbols and the Accounting Department will have none of this.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Complete the <code>rename_keys()</code> function to remove the <code>@</code> character from the beginning of the dictionary key names(<strong>Warning</strong>: Not all the dictionary keys are strings.)</p>
<p>You should return a new dictionary object and <strong>NOT</strong> modify the input data in place.</p>
<p>Example:&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; rename_keys({'@user_name': 'jdoe'})<br />{'user_name': 'jdoe'}</pre>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The input data maybe a deeply nested structure, take a look at the tests for examples.</p>
